    "summary": "A pharmacist inadvertently provided information about a man's Viagra prescription to his estranged wife.  The complaint stemmed from one phone call back in 2011. John Doe's ex-wife was a pharmacist in a different town. When she allegedly called the Willmar pharmacist at the Willmar Kmart store seeking John Doe's prescription information, the pharmacist provided it, even though John Doe had reportedly specially requested that his information not be disseminated.",
