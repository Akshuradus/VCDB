    "summary": "Jonathan Lee Eubanks, a 29-year-old Florida man, has been sentenced to seven years in federal prison after he used a remote access Trojan (RAT) to rain down cyber fire and brimstone on his former employer.  His crimes: rerouting visitors to his former employer’s website to a rival’s site; deleting all the files on the company server; hacking into an email account and masquerading as a former colleague in order to send messages full of criticism and accusations of corporate malfeasance; and stealing three credit cards from a security company software maker and using them to order rifle scopes, electronics and survivalist gear.  The recipient of his felonious wrath was Navarro Security Group, a private security services company in Florida.",
