    "summary": "Cloudflare security breach exposed data and changing the passwords are recommended among 3,400 websites. Cloudflare is an online content delivery network, which offers CDN, DNS, DDoS protection, and security.  Some usernames and passwords were leaked because of a security bug that affected 3,400 websites, including Uber, Fitbit, and OkCupid. However, 1Password has the end-to-end encryption, which means no data was exposed. The leaked passwords were cached by search engines, which recommends users to change it.",
