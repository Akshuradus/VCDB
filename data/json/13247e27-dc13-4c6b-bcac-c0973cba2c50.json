    "summary": "In Singapore’s worst cyber attack, hackers have stolen the personal particulars of 1.5 million patients. Of these, 160,000 people, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and a few ministers, had their outpatient prescriptions stolen as well.  The hackers infiltrated the computers of SingHealth, Singapore's largest group of healthcare institutions with four hospitals, five national speciality centres and eight polyclinics. Two other polyclinics used to be under SingHealth.Sophisticated cyber attackers who are “typically state-linked” were behind the unprecedented cyber attack on Singapore’s largest public healthcare group SingHealth, Communications and Information Minister S Iswaran disclosed in Parliament on Monday (Aug 6).  This is the first time the authorities have identified the suspects as being potentially state-linked.  Delivering a ministerial statement on the cyber attack — the most serious yet to hit Singapore — Mr Iswaran said that the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) had determined, after a detailed analysis, that an “advanced-persistent-threat group” was behind the breach.",
