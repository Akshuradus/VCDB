Potentially, the breach impacted all patients whose information was recorded during a visit to a SMART center prior to December 31, 2016. The breach, which occurred in September 2017, was an extortion attempt. Hackers gained access to SMART systems, allegedly stole data, and demanded a ransom payment to prevent the information from being released online.",
