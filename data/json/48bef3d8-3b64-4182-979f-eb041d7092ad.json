    "summary": "In late 2014, Z.D. was a patient in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at CAMC and Andrekia Lawton was informed by an acquaintance of hers that a representative of the hospital’s NICU had contacted the acquaintance and shared Z.D.’s medical information for the purpose of seeking authorization to perform a medical procedure on Z.D., according to a complaint filed in Kanawha Circuit Court.  Lawton claims the acquaintance was mistakenly contacted by the representative because she was pregnant at the same time and had received treatment at CAMC and the acquaintance believed the information being shared with her concerned her unborn child.",
