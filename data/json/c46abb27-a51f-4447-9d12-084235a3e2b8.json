    "summary": "A paper file containing medical information for about 1000 patients has been stolen from a locked office at Health Sciences Centre.  Winnipeg Regional Health Authority Chief Operating Officer Real Cloutier says it happened in early October and police have been called in.  “We do have some footage in the general area that investigators are looking at,” says Cloutier. “It was a secure area. The room where the information was enclosed had a lock so we don’t think it was somebody from the public.”  He adds that while the breach is still considered very serious, the information that was stolen was fairly minimal including patient names, birth dates, file numbers and the medical procedure they had done at the hospital.",
