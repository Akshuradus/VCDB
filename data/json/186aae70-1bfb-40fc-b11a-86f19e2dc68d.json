    "summary": "UPMC Susquehanna has notified 1,200 patients treated at various UPMC Susquehanna locations that their personal information — including names, dates of birth, contact information and Social Security numbers — may have been inappropriately accessed.  The breach was discovered on Sept. 21, when an employee reported suspicious activity to the information technology staff. As a result of UPMC Susquehanna’s internal investigation, it is believed that through a phishing attack the information may have been accessed.",
