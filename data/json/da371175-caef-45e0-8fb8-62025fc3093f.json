    "summary": "An email was sent during the afternoon of Sunday, November 5, to around 300 postgraduate research students in the social science faculty, one of the UEAâ€™s four teaching departments, containing personal information about a member of staff.  The breach occurred due to the accidental use of an email distribution list, the same as the data leak in June, which affected hundreds of American Studies students.",
