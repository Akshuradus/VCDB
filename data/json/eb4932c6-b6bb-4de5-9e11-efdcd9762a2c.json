    "summary": "The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) announced that it suffered a healthcare phishing attack and that certain PHI may have been affected as it was in the accessed employee email accounts.  An investigation and manual document review showed that an unauthorized third party accessed “a limited number” of MCW employee email accounts, and that they were compromised between July 21, 2017 and July 28, 2017. It could not be definitively concluded though whether patient PHI was actually accessed, viewed, downloaded or otherwise acquired.",
