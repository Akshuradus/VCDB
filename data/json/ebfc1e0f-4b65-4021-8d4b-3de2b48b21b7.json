    "summary": "Brooks Brothers recently became aware of a security incident that could affect the payment card information of some customers who made purchases at certain Brooks Brothers and Brooks Brothers Outlet retail locations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico only between April 4, 2016 and March 1, 2017.  It appears that an unauthorized individual was able to gain access to and install malicious software designed to capture payment card information on some of our payment processing systems at our retail and outlet locations.",
