    "summary": "State Sen. Siobhan S. Dunnavant, a Henrico County physician, broke federal health privacy rules by sending a political solicitation to her patients during her 2015 campaign, according to a letter from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights office.  Dunnavant’s decision to share patient contact information with her Senate campaign and its direct-mail business was “impermissible” under federal HIPAA law, HHS investigators wrote in a letter last month informing Dunnavant and her attorney that the case was being closed.",
