    "summary": "A Houston man has been sentenced to 27 months in prison for damaging 13 servers and committing wire fraud on Fredericktown, Penn.-based Centerville Clinics' computers in 2013, according to the Department of Justice.  Centerville Clinics hired Brandon A. Coughlin, 29, as an in-house computer systems administrator January 16, 2013. Nearly one month later, February 4, 2013, he resigned at the request of management.  On Sept. 18, 2013, Mr. Coughlin used administrative passwords, which had remained unchanged since his employment, to hack computer networks and disable all administrative accounts. He deleted users' network shares, business data and patient health information, including medical records. This hack caused the clinic to cease medical treatment of its patients until its systems were restored, costing Centerville approximately $60,000.",
