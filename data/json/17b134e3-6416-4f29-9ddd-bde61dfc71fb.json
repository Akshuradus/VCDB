    "summary": "AN IT worker of ele.me has been detained for leaking data of over 65,000 employees.  Police said yesterday that the suspect, a man surnamed Xiang, claimed that he did so because the company was being “unfair” to him. Xiang was working as a senior research and development engineer at ele.me, a leading online food ordering platform.  The company reported the leak to Putuo police at 11pm last Thursday after staff at its risk control department discovered that the data of its employees, including their names, sexes and mail addresses, had appeared on a website.",
